# secure_login
I wanted to try and create a secure login by having the program change the password into a Hash value that it stores on a text file. When the user types the password again, the program will turn the text into a Hash value that is compared to the stored hash value in the text file. It is written in python.
Either run the program in a terminal or an IDE like pycharm. I don't know how github works, but I always appreciate any feedback.
